# 🧵 Learning Python Multitasking with Threads!

Welcome to my Python multitasking folder — a space where I'm exploring how to make programs do **multiple things at once** using **threads**.

---

## 🚀 Why Threads?

Sometimes, one task at a time just isn't enough.  
What if your program could:

- Download a file 📥
- Show a progress bar 📊
- And respond to user input 💬  
...**all at the same time?**

That's where **multithreading** comes in!

## 🔍 What I'm Exploring

In this folder, I'm trying out things like:

- Running custom functions in separate threads
- Creating my own thread classes
- Understanding how threads start and run
- Slowly building toward real-world multitasking apps!

## 🧠 What I Hope to Learn

✅ The basics of Python's `threading` module  
✅ How to avoid mistakes when running tasks in parallel  
✅ Thread safety (coming soon...)  
✅ And most importantly — **when and why to use threads**

## 📈 A Learning Journey

This isn’t just code — it’s a **log of what I’m discovering**.  
Some things might be simple, some tricky, but every file here is a step forward. 💡

Thanks for stopping by!  
Stick around — more updates coming soon as I go deeper into the world of Python multitasking. 🚀
